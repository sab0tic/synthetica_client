* * * * * SYNTHETICA MINECRAFT 1.7.10 MODPACK * * * * *

below are step-by-step instructions for how to get the in-development modpack working, piggybacked onto an FTB mod! 
this is by no means the only awy to get the back working, but in my opinion, it's the least of a headache!


(1)  if you haven't already done so, download an FTB modpack in the FTB launcher. i piggybacked onto FTBLite3 mostly because it is a small download. ill be referring to the original pack as FTBLite3, but you can really use whichever one you want.

(2a) goto the /minecraft in the modpack base directory "ftb/FTBLite3/"
(2b) rename the mods and configs to something else (e.g. mods.old)
(2c) move _all_ files and folders that were pulled, including the hidden .git folder. it should ask if you want to overwrite "pack.json", that's a good thing, proceed!

(3) move the new forge directory from the modpack base "ftb\FTBLite3" into "ftb\libraries\net\minecraftforge\forge"
